  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  - assets/images/
  - assets/svgs/
  - assets/sound/
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
  - family: Roboto_Condensed
    fonts:
    - asset: fonts/RobotoCondensed-Medium.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  - family: Poppins
    fonts:
    - asset: fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
